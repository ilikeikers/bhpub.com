bhpub website

This website is no longer live.

It also wasn't a great website, and it could have been a lot better. However, it was primarily a learning project.

I worked at Braveheart's Pub in Alma, MI, and this was a website I made for them. The owner decided a long time ago to use only Facebook for his business, 
but he was kind enough to let me essentially create a landing page for him. It mainly just linked back to facebook, or the QR Code Links we already had in place.
When I left that job, we decided it'd be best that we take it down and just go back to Facebook. 

This is simply here for archival reasons and to take a gander at some bad code if interested. 

It was hosted on Vultr using a Debian Server. It used Nginx as the web server.
